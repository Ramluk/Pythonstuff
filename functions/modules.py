"""You can store your functions ina separate file called a module
and then import that module into your main program using an import statement.
This allows you to hide the details of your programs code and focus on higher level logic
in the main program. It also promotes code reusability."""

"""Syntax: import filename ---- This will make every function from the module available in your program.
To call a function use this syntax: module_name.function_name()"""
